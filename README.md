# What is CryptoVenom?


CryptoVenom is an OpenSource tool which contains a lot of cryptosystems and cryptoanalysis methods all in one, including
classical algorithms, hash algorithms, encoding algorithms, logic gates, mathematical functions, modern symmetric and asymmetric encryptions etc.


# What is the Purpose of CryptoVenom?

Make easier the cryptoanalysis or the usage of cryptosystems and manipulation of them.

If you are a CTF Player or just a curious student with just learning purposes this is your tool!


# Errors? Updates?

As this is a very big tool, and I created it alone there might be some errors in it, if you get an error,
or some functionality of the tool is not working for you please contact as soon as possible with me through telegram (@LockedByte), email (alejandro.guerrero.rodriguez2@gmail.com) or just open it in gitHub. I'll patch all these errors quickly.

# Dependencies? Setup? Installing?

CryptoVenom is JUST working for linux, I tested it just in kali and in Parrot OS, if you are in another dist and you have problems let me know. Installing is a very simple process, just execute as root the setup.py file and dependencies will be installed.
